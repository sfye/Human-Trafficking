Human-Trafficking
=================

While in Grad School, I designed and developed this data visualization about human trafficking survivors, who have been sex or labor trafficked from around the world. Every year, thousands of men, women and children fall into the hands of traffickers, in their own countries and abroad. Almost every country in the world is affected by trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims. My project plays the audio of some surviving victims while visually displaying facts of human trafficking. I'm looking to create a similar project using rafael.js and donate it to an anti human trafficking organization.
